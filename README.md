# Welcome to MoviEATS.

The purpose of this app is to pair food suggestions with specific movie genres. The user will enter a movie and based on that genre, the app will suggest four different types of foods for the user to choose from. This is targeted towards the movie and food enthusiasts who are looking for a unique experience.

## Who is our user?
movie loving foodies who are enjoy unconventional entertainment experiences

## What is their problem?
"I want to provide a unique experience for my company coming over, but it's raining out!"

## Our Solution
Providing them a memorable experience that satisfies their foodie inclinations, movie enthusiasm and eccentricities.

## Elevator pitch 
Here’s an idea, try moviEats - for something unique. just enter a movie you want to watch, our app will select a food that’ll enhance your experience

## Styling
We wanted to give a very cinematic experience to the user. We started with a black background with two select images of theatres, depending on the media query. It either looks as if the recipe is the "main feature" (with rows of theater seats and patrons below), or luxurious looking drapes. The font was used to emulate a light up bulb style marquee. CSS, HTML and JavaScript were used for creating the elements and styling.

## jQuery
the jQuery library was used for accessing external APIs (OMDB and Spoonacular)
